# calendar-planner

## Description

The goal was to create a workday hourly planner that allows the user to input tasks for a day based on hourly time blocks. The planner visually shows the date of the day in addition to color visualization to represent past, current, and future hourly tasks. Users can save entries using the save button to save tasks to a specific date/time.
